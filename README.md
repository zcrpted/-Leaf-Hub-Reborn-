The Leaf Hub Reborn is a custom script 
made with rayfield ui, which is a public script format
for storing your scripts in one place.


This is a custom made one and if you found this
i didnt intend it to be publicly used and more like
a script that has all the scripts i use so i dont go searching 
for them.


So if you found it then I guess hello and thanks
for using this script as maybe people will use it
but its really small and has scripts for specific
games i play and random scripts.


I share this script with my friends but I dont know. If you wanna use 
this script then your free too just please dont steal it and
reupload it and rename it then saying its yours. Dont do that like
cmon bro.




thats all for the read me!
